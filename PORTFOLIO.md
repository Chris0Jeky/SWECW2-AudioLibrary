# Audio Library Management System - Portfolio Documentation

## Project Overview

The Audio Library Management System is a modern C++ application that demonstrates advanced software engineering principles through the implementation of a high-performance music catalog system. Originally developed as a second-year computer science project, it has been completely redesigned and enhanced to showcase professional-grade C++ development skills.

### Key Achievements

- **Complete Architecture Redesign**: Transformed from a basic hash table implementation to a modern, thread-safe, feature-rich application
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved O(1) average-case search complexity with intelligent indexing
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminated all memory leaks and dangling pointers using smart pointers
- **Thread Safety**: Implemented concurrent read/write operations using modern synchronization primitives
- **Code Quality**: 100% clean compilation with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` flags

## Technical Architecture

### Core Design Patterns

#### 1. **Smart Pointer Memory Management**
```cpp
using TrackPtr = std::shared_ptr<Track>;
```
- Prevents memory leaks through automatic reference counting
- Enables safe sharing of track objects between multiple indexes
- Eliminates dangling pointer issues present in the original implementation

#### 2. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
- All resources are managed through object lifetimes
- File handles automatically closed through destructors
- Mutex locks released automatically via lock guards

#### 3. **Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern**
- Music library protected by `std::shared_mutex`
- Multiple concurrent readers, exclusive writers
- Lock-free read operations for maximum performance

### Data Structure Design

#### Multi-Index Architecture
The system maintains multiple hash-based indexes for O(1) lookups:

```cpp
std::unordered_multimap<std::string, size_t> title_index_;
std::unordered_multimap<std::string, size_t> artist_index_;
std::unordered_multimap<std::string, size_t> album_index_;
std::unordered_multimap<std::string, size_t> genre_index_;
```

This design allows:
- Instant lookup by any field
- Memory-efficient storage (tracks stored once, referenced multiple times)
- Support for multiple tracks with the same title/artist

#### Inverted Index for Full-Text Search
```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<IndexEntry>> inverted_index_;
```
- Tokenized text search across all fields
- Weighted relevance scoring
- Support for multiple search modes

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Search Engine Capabilities**

The search engine supports five different search modes:

- **Exact Match**: Perfect string matching
- **Prefix Search**: Autocomplete-style matching
- **Substring Search**: Contains-style matching
- **Fuzzy Search**: Levenshtein distance-based matching for typo tolerance
- **Regex Search**: Full regular expression support

#### Fuzzy Search Implementation
```cpp
size_t levenshtein_distance(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    // Dynamic programming approach for edit distance
    std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<size_t>(n + 1));
    // ... implementation
}
```

### 2. **File Format Support**

#### CSV Parser with Quoted Field Support
- Handles embedded commas, quotes, and newlines
- Automatic header detection
- Error recovery and validation

#### JSON Import/Export
- Custom lightweight JSON parser
- Escape sequence handling
- Pretty-print formatting option

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

- **String Interning**: Common strings stored once
- **Move Semantics**: Efficient object transfers
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Search results computed on-demand
- **Cache-Friendly Design**: Data structures optimized for CPU cache

## Code Quality Metrics

### Compilation Standards
- **C++17 Standard**: Modern language features
- **Zero Warnings**: Clean compilation with all warnings enabled
- **Static Analysis**: Passes cppcheck and clang-tidy

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive Catch2 test suite
- **Thread Safety Tests**: Concurrent operation verification
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Empty strings, large datasets, invalid inputs

### Memory Safety
- **No Raw Pointers**: All dynamic memory managed by smart pointers
- **RAII Everywhere**: Automatic resource management
- **Bounds Checking**: Safe array access with `.at()`

## Modern C++ Features Utilized

### C++17 Features
- `std::optional` for nullable return values
- `std::filesystem` for cross-platform file operations
- Structured bindings for cleaner code
- `[[nodiscard]]` attributes for API safety
- `if` statements with initializers

### STL Mastery
- `std::shared_mutex` for reader-writer locks
- `std::unordered_multimap` for efficient indexing
- `std::regex` for pattern matching
- `std::chrono` for duration handling
- Algorithm library for functional operations

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Add Track | O(1) | Amortized, with index updates |
| Search by Title/Artist | O(1) | Direct hash lookup |
| Substring Search | O(n·m) | n = terms, m = query length |
| Fuzzy Search | O(n·m²) | With edit distance calculation |
| List All Tracks | O(n) | Linear scan required |

### Space Complexity
- **Memory Usage**: O(n) where n is the number of tracks
- **Index Overhead**: ~4x track count for multi-field indexing
- **Shared Pointers**: Minimal overhead (24 bytes per shared_ptr)

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Defensive Programming
```cpp
if (!safe_getline(input)) {
    return; // Graceful handling of EOF/errors
}
```

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized and validated
- File existence checks before operations
- Graceful degradation on errors

### Exception Safety
- Strong exception guarantee where possible
- RAII ensures cleanup even on exceptions
- No resource leaks on error paths

## User Experience Design

### Interactive CLI Features
- **Clear Screen Navigation**: Clean transitions between menus
- **Input Validation**: Immediate feedback on invalid entries
- **Progress Indicators**: For long operations
- **Contextual Help**: Suggested corrections for failed searches
- **Export Capabilities**: Save search results directly

### Accessibility
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS
- **No External Dependencies**: Just standard C++ library
- **Clear Error Messages**: User-friendly error reporting

## Build System

### Dual Build Support
1. **Traditional Make**: For Unix-like systems
2. **CMake**: For cross-platform builds
3. **Optimized Flags**: `-O2` optimization by default

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Automated code coverage reporting

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- All file paths validated
- CSV injection prevention
- Buffer overflow protection

### Resource Limits
- Maximum file size checks
- Duration validation (1-36000 seconds)
- Year range validation (1900-2100)

## Future Extensibility

The architecture supports easy addition of:
- New metadata fields (just add to Track class)
- New search modes (add to SearchEngine enum)
- New file formats (implement in FileIO)
- Database backends (replace file storage)
- REST API (add HTTP server layer)
