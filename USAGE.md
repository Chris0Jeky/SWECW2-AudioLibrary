.\audio_library_tests.exe "[track]"
.\audio_library_tests.exe "[music_library]"
.\audio_library_tests.exe "[search_engine]"
```

## Linux/WSL

## Troubleshooting

### "make: command not found"
- Install Make via Cygwin, MinGW, or use WSL
- Alternatively, compile manually:
  ```powershell
  g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude src/audio_library/*.cpp src/main.cpp -o music_manager.exe
  ```

### Line ending issues on Windows
- The project uses Unix line endings (LF)
- If you get errors about `\r`, use `dos2unix` or open in a text editor and save with Unix line endings

### Missing sample data
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- Check that `data/sample_tracks.csv` exists
- Use relative path: `data\sample_tracks.csv` on Windows
